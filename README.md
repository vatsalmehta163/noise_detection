# Environmental Noise Detection

This project focuses on detecting and classifying environmental noise to enhance audio clarity for speech recognition and adaptive noise cancellation. Using **Librosa** for feature extraction and spectrogram-based training, the model effectively differentiates between noise and speech.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects and classifies environmental noise.
- Enhances speech recognition by reducing background disturbances.
- Utilizes **Librosa** for feature extraction and **spectrogram-based** analysis.
- Potential applications in **smart assistants, adaptive noise cancellation, and real-time audio processing**.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of audio clips containing environmental noise and speech disturbances. It was sourced from **[Kaggle's Noise Cancellation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srujannagamally/noise-cancellation?select=clean_testset_wav)**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Librosa** (Feature Extraction)
- **Spectrograms & Audio Processing**
- **Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/noise-detection.git
   cd noise-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📌 Usage
1. **Run the script** to extract features and classify noise:
   ```bash
   python noise_detection.py
   ```
2. **Modify parameters** in the script for different noise thresholds.

## 📊 Results
- The model achieved **high accuracy** in detecting environmental noise.
- Improves **speech clarity** for AI-powered assistants and audio applications.
